You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

After analyzing the San Francisco Crime Data from 2003 to 2015, it was found that the overall crime rate in the city had significantly decreased during this period. This trend is particularly notable in the category of property crimes.
In 2003, the number of reported property crimes in San Francisco was 56,759, while in 2015, the number had decreased to 36,013, a reduction of 36.5%. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.
One of the reasons for the decrease in property crime could be attributed to advancements in security technology. More people are installing surveillance cameras, motion sensors, and alarm systems, making it harder for criminals to carry out their activities. Additionally, law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly to reduce crime rates by increasing patrols, implementing community policing programs, and working with local businesses to improve security.
However, not all categories of crime have seen a decrease. The number of reported violent crimes has remained relatively stable throughout the years, with 7,937 incidents in 2003 and 7,796 incidents in 2015. This is a reminder that there is still work to be done to ensure the safety of all San Francisco residents.
Overall, the decrease in property crime is a positive development for the city of San Francisco. It shows that efforts to improve security and reduce crime rates have been effective. However, it is important to continue investing in community policing programs, increasing patrols, and working with local businesses to ensure that all residents feel safe and secure in their neighborhoods.
