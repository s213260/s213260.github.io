Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding trends and patterns in large datasets. This is supposed to be an interactive plot of crime counts by day of the week and time of day in San Francisco, helping to identify when and where crimes are most likely to occur.

The resulting visualization is a stacked bar chart, with each bar representing a day of the week and each color representing a specific crime type. The legend should allow the user to interactively mute/unmute specific crime types.

The plot should be interective. It is a plot made by bokeh.
