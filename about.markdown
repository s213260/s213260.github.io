The website features a collection of articles about the city of San Francisco, each focusing on a different aspect of crime in the city. Despite the varying topics covered in the articles, a consistent theme emerges as each article utilizes visualizations to enhance understanding and offer insight into the city's crime patterns. The data set used to create these visualizations is the same one used in Assignment 1, which details crimes in San Francisco between 2003 and 2018. Through these articles and accompanying visualizations, readers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the city's crime trends and the impact they have on the community.
